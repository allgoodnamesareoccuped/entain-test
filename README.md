## Getting Started

### Installation

```shell
npm install
```

### Start Cypress

```shell
npx cypress open
```
There's only one test thats called spec.cy.js


 ðŸš© **Note**
 I Choose to use Cypress since it's easy to setup and run.
 I started out with some simple tests around the UI to get an idea on how the website is working.
 
 What would be good to do with a bit more time would be:
 1. Add the tests to the Next-to-go project
 2. Make the lookup of objects on the page a bit more consistent, and create a template on what would be best practise.
 3. Add api Testing
 4. Add unit Testing
 5. Add vue component testing
